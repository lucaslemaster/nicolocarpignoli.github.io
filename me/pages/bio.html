                    I'm a Software Engineer, currently working as Web Developer at <a class="inline" href="https://chialab.it">Chialab</a>, a communication and design company based in Bologna.
                    I am a PhD Candidate at IUAV University of Design in Venice, with a project about vibrotactile prototype for exploring graphics for blind students learning.

                <p>
                    I graduated at 25 in Software Engineering in Bologna. My graduation thesis was about IoT in Sports, and featured the implementation
                    of a complete IoT platform, moving data from sensors to a Web dashboard.

                    After 4+ of experience working with Web technologies, I discovered my passion about innovative communication solutions such as Augmented Reality.
                    So, I started to dig into AR.js, the most popular Web AR project in Open Source. With time, I became the maintainer of the project and now I continue to keep it alive and to build a community around it.
                    I led the project for two years, periodically adding features to it and managing issues, now the project is belonging to an Open Source Organization at Github. I'm still following the progresses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm the author of GeoAR.js, the first Location-Based Web AR library, written in Javascript and thought for the Web, on 2019 I also contributed to
                    jsartoolkit5 on bringing AR Image Tracking on the Web for the first time ever.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm also an expert about Web Accessibility. I periodically write on Medium, a blog platform, about Augmented Reality, Agile development and Accessibility.
                    Sometimes I like to take part to tech conferences and webinars as speaker.
                    I have also teaching experience on Agile Software Development in post-graduate schools, in Bologna.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My aim is to make possible for everyone, students, artists, teachers, developers, to build useful experiences with Augmented Reality, for free, using Open Source software.
                    Augmented Reality can be used for learning, to treat particular kinds of phobias, to find new ways of interacting with the world, and to communicate.
                    It can be used to provide informations that we usually don't have, and to provide help to those who need it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I see too much potential on this technology wasted with funny and unuseful projects. There's nothing bad in having fun with it.
                    What's not right, in my opinion, is to concentrate on technology only and not enough on its possible, useful use cases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    AR is used a lot on learning. Or at least, lots of teachers reached me because they would like to use it for their lessons, but sadly, tools are expensive and complex.
                    To make designers, artists and teachers able to create and deploy Web AR experiences I designed AR.js Studio, an authoring platform for Web AR.
                    I did a 'call to arms' and lots of great designers and developers helped me on this project. I'm very grateful to all of them.
                    As of December 2020 it is still in alpha version but it is usable. My aim is to get fundings in order to make it a truly alternative to the expensive commercial competitors.

                    From October 2020 I'm a PhD Candidate at the IUAV University on the "Design, City and Architecture" program. My PhD research is about accessibility of Tactile Graphics
                    on general-purpose devices like tablets and smartphones, using vibrations.
                    The aim is to find an inexpensive and portable solution in order to perceive visual information - using vibrations - for the blinds.

                </p>
                <p>
                    As of 2021 my focus are on my fulltime job at Chialab and my ongoing PhD Research.
                    I left the "unofficial" role of maintainer of AR.js: both AR.js and AR.js-Studio are now owned by a public Github organization, everyone is free to join
                    and contribute. I'm still available for consulting and small projects about AR, Web AR and Accessibility.
